Prototype Using the STM32F429 Discovery Board
===============================================


This the firmware for the Discovery Board. 

Written is C using Embitz IDE.

The firmware is built on top of ChibiOS which has excellent support for STM32.

The graphics engine is handled by uGFX. 

This code is highly alpha with many bugs and crashes. It is a work in progress. 


Eventually this will be turned into the firmware for the final hardare prototype.
