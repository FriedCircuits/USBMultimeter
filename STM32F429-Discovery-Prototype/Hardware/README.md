Hardware for USB Multimeter STM32F429 Add-on Board
======================================================


Warning: The TX/RX pairs need to be swapped for this design to work.

I only made one spin of this board and ended up swapping the pairs with some bodge wires.

Also there is an I2C address conflict with the INA219's. I forgot to set the 2nd one to another address.



This is here just as a referance as this was a one off board.
